# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code Project Instructions

This is a BiltIQ AI repository. Before doing anything in this repo, you must understand the project context, the engineering process, and the rules that govern code in this codebase.

The `biltiq-engineering` plugin is installed and provides the canonical workflow. Skills auto-trigger via the SessionStart hook.

---

## Read order (mandatory before any task)

Read these files in this order before generating, editing, or reviewing any code:

1. **`AGENT_RULES.md`** (repo root) — canonical behavior rules. The 11 anti-patterns, code conventions, banned vocabulary, security rules, **compliance mode**.
2. **`MEMORY.md`** (repo root) — persistent project state. Current focus, recent decisions, known issues, open questions.
3. **`/docs/CONTEXT.md`** — what this product does, who uses it, what we explicitly don't do.
4. **`/docs/GLOSSARY.md`** — project-specific terms. Product names, infrastructure, acronyms.
5. **`/docs/architecture/overview.md`** — system architecture for this repo.
6. **`/docs/architecture/stack.md`** — libraries, wrappers, and utilities available in this repo. Read this before writing any new code (Anti-Pattern #1 defense).
7. **`/docs/architecture/approved-versions.md`** — current vs deprecated APIs (Anti-Pattern #9 defense).
8. **`DESIGN.md`** (repo root, if present) — design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing). All HTML artifacts inherit these tokens.

For task-specific work, additionally read:

- `/docs/specs/<task-id>/spec.html`
- `/docs/specs/<task-id>/design.html`
- `/docs/specs/<task-id>/plan.html`

If any of those are missing, **stop and tell the dev** — the task is not ready to start.

## How to work in this repo

Use the BiltIQ Attack Loop: **Think → Plan → Build → Review → Test → Ship → Reflect.** The 7 slash commands provided by the `biltiq-engineering` plugin map to these steps:

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| 1 Think | `/biltiq-engineering:think <task-id>` |
| 2 Plan | `/biltiq-engineering:plan <task-id>` |
| 3 Build | `/biltiq-engineering:build <task-id>` |
| 4 Review | `/biltiq-engineering:review <task-id>` |
| 5 Test | `/biltiq-engineering:test <task-id>` |
| 6 Ship | `/biltiq-engineering:ship <task-id>` |
| 7 Reflect | `/biltiq-engineering:reflect <task-id>` |

Or run the full pipeline by invoking the `attack-loop-orchestrator` skill: tell the agent "let's do BILTIQ-XXX" and it will walk the loop.

For planning, code review, test generation, and doc generation, use the named skills (`plan-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `test-generator`, `doc-generator`). They auto-trigger when relevant; you can also invoke explicitly.

---

## Queue-driven dispatch (v1.9.0)

The plugin proactively manages your work queue. At session start (and after each commit), the `_work_queue.py` scanner reads in-flight specs and emits an `ACTION:` directive — e.g., `ACTION: /biltiq-engineering:build BILTIQ-123` — telling you what to do next. The orchestrator auto-chains steps within a session without "go?" prompts. Follow this protocol:

1. Read the `ACTION:` directive from the queue summary.
2. Announce intent: "Resuming BILTIQ-123 at Build step 3."
3. Wait one turn for redirect.
4. Execute if no redirect.

If the queue says `ACTION: /biltiq-engineering:eod (overdue)` — your end-of-day report is missing and UTC is past noon. Write it before continuing feature work.

## Plugin surface (v1.9.0)

The `biltiq-engineering` plugin ships <!-- biltiq-stat:skill-count -->118<!-- /biltiq-stat:skill-count --> skills and exposes three invocation surfaces. All three share the `biltiq` prefix in different shapes — slash commands use `/biltiq-engineering:<name>`, subagents use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: biltiq-engineering:<name>`, and scripts are called by slash commands (rarely invoked directly).

### Slash commands (27 total, all `/biltiq-engineering:<name>`)

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| Attack Loop (7) | `think`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `test`, `ship`, `reflect` |
| Lightweight (1) | `micro` |
| Lifecycle (5) | `init-repo`, `adopt`, `audit`, `refresh-arch`, `new-task` |
| Quality (1) | `scan` |
| Git (3) | `commit`, `commit-push-pr`, `clean-gone` |
| Memory (2) | `compact-now`, `archive-commit` |
| Automation (2) | `auto-test`, `auto-doc` |
| Reporting (3) | `standup`, `eod`, `milestone-status` |
| Documentation (1) | `product-docs` |
| Estimation (1) | `estimate` |
| Diagnostics (1) | `doctor` |
| CLI wrapper (2) | `graph`, `siem` |

### Subagents (6, dispatched via Agent tool with `subagent_type: biltiq-engineering:<name>`)

| Subagent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `biltiq-code-explorer` | Step 1 (Think) deep-read of existing modules → `code-explorer.md` |
| `biltiq-code-architect` | Step 2 (Plan) blueprint design from existing patterns |
| `biltiq-code-reviewer` | Step 4 (Review) parallel-dispatch review of file slices |
| `biltiq-plan-reviewer` | Plan-reviewer for parallel-task plans and high-risk tasks |
| `biltiq-code-simplifier` | Refactor a slice for clarity, behavior-preserving |
| `biltiq-anti-pattern-auditor` | Full-repo audit against the 11 anti-patterns |

### Scripts (8, under `scripts/` — usually invoked by slash commands)

| Script / dir | Invoked by |
|---|---|
| `biltiq-init.sh` | `/biltiq-engineering:init-repo` |
| `biltiq-audit.sh` | `/biltiq-engineering:audit` |
| `biltiq-new-task.sh` | `/biltiq-engineering:new-task` |
| `biltiq-auto-log.sh` | Hourly hook → feeds `auto-test` / `auto-doc` |
| `biltiq-usage.sh` | `/biltiq-engineering:eod --usage-only` |
| `biltiq-graph/` (CLI) | `/biltiq-engineering:graph` |
| `biltiq-siem/` (CLI) | `/biltiq-engineering:siem` |
| `_vllm_socratic_driver.py` | `/biltiq-engineering:think`, `/biltiq-engineering:plan`, `/biltiq-engineering:reflect` — drives on-prem vLLM Socratic dialogue (one AC at a time, adversarial review + lock/unlock signals). Call: `drive_socratic_session(task_id, initial_context)` where `initial_context = {"task_id": str, "acs": [{"id", "text", "status"}], "required_shape": {"headings": [...], "expected_ac_count": int}}`. Returns resolved context dict; on vLLM failure or AC18 quality-gate fatal verdict returns `{"fallback_marker": "inline-Claude-required"}` — harness falls back to inline Claude rendering. |

## What NOT to do in this repo

- **No vibe coding.** Don't generate code without `spec.html`, `design.html`, and `plan.html` present and reviewed.
- **No silent assumptions.** If `spec.html` is ambiguous, ask. Don't guess.
- **No throwaway file residue.** Delete experimental files before committing — no `auth_v2.py`, `auth_new.py`, `*.bak`, `test_scratch_*.py`. CI will fail the PR if these exist.
- **No `any` / `Any` types.** No `# type: ignore` without an inline comment justifying it.
- **No banned vocabulary** in code comments, docs, or commit messages: "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "empowering", "seamless", "future-ready".
- **No external AI / cloud LLM calls** if this repo's compliance mode in `AGENT_RULES.md` is `on_prem_required`. If `on_prem_preferred`, only with an ADR. If `cloud_ok`, still requires an ADR for any new AI dependency.

## Updating MEMORY.md

After significant work in a session, invoke the `memory-curator` skill or update manually:

- New context the next session should know (decisions, gotchas, things in flux).
- Items completed (move from "Current focus" to "Recently completed").
- New open questions.

Don't bloat. Keep under 200 lines. If it grows beyond that, the `memory-curator` skill archives older entries to `/docs/memory-archive/YYYY-MM.md`.

---

## Reporting back to the dev

When you finish a unit of work, summarize:

1. What you did (1-2 sentences).
2. What files changed (list).
3. What tests you generated (count + criterion coverage).
4. Any anti-patterns you avoided (e.g., "I noticed `BaseHTTPClient` already exists in `core/http.py`, so I used it instead of raw `httpx`").
5. Anything you flagged as needing human attention.

Plain reporting only.
