# /docs/GLOSSARY.md — Project Vocabulary

**Purpose:** Domain terms specific to this project (and BiltIQ's shared vocabulary). The agent reads this so it doesn't misinterpret internal vocabulary or invent its own definitions.

**Update rules:**
- Alphabetical within each section.
- One line per term where possible.
- New entries require no approval — anyone can add. Removals/edits go through PR review.
