```php
/**
 * Process a payment order and return a confirmation receipt.
 *
 * @param string $orderId Unique identifier for the order. Must not be empty.
 * @param float  $amount  Payment amount in base currency. Must be > 0.
 *
 * @return Receipt A receipt with `status` and `receiptId` properties.
 *
 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException If $orderId is empty or $amount is not positive.
 * @throws PaymentGatewayException   If the upstream processor is unavailable.
 *
 * @example
 * $receipt = $service->processOrder('ord_123', 49.99);
 * echo $receipt->status; // "ok"
 *
 * Side effects (compliance-relevant): Writes to payment audit log; calls external payment gateway.
 * Tenant context: Scoped to the authenticated tenant's payment account.
 * Compliance mode (when stricter than ambient): PCI-DSS scope — card data must not appear in logs.
